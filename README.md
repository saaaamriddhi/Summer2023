# Summer2023
This contains all the tasks and projects that I took up and finished successfully in the Summer of 2023. 

I am out of my home, and my boundaries of how much work can be done in one day. I am here at Linux World Informatics Pvt. Ltd., and here, we cross the limits every day. I take classes for almost 8 hours. And then I practice all that I learned. Then I also voluntarily help other people in the internship, with their practices. 

Doing so much is already a rush of power, and then comes the part where I am meeting and being with so many amazing, smart people of my age for almost 12-14 hours.
